PROBLEM STATEMENT

Create an array of n integers, where the value of n is passed as an argument to the pre-filled function in your editor. This challenge uses a custom checker, so you can create any array of n integers. For example, if n=4, you could return [1,1,1,1],[1,2,3,4], or any other array of equal length.

Note: Code stubs are provided for almost every language in which you must either fill in a blank (i.e., ____) or write your code in the area specified by comments.

Method Signature

Number Of Parameters: 1
Parameters: [n]
Returns: List or Vector
Input Format

A single integer,n.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 100
The members returned by the list/vector/array must be integers.

Output Format

The function must return an array, list, or vector of n integers. Stub code in the editor prints this to stdout as a space, comma, or semicolon-separated list (depending on your submission language).

Note: Your output need not match the Expected Output exactly; the size of your printed list is confirmed by a custom checker, which determines whether or not you passed each test case.

Sample Input 0

10

Sample Output 0

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Sample Input 1

3

Sample Output 1

[1, 2, 3]
